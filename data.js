	info:"Trevor Paglen Title: Monsters in the Smart City Abstract: Monsters lurk in the epistemological and political foundations of “smart” cities, computer vision systems, and artificial intelligence networks. Tortured kittens, 19th Century phrenologists, Stalinist theories of aesthetics, and actual vampires are but some of the bad inhabitants of the built environments and infrastructures we find ourselves increasingly enmeshed within. In this talk, artist/geographer Trevor Paglen shows how struggles over rights in an automated landscape entail new and urgent struggles over meaning itself. Bio: Trevor Paglen is an artist whose work spans image-making, sculpture, investigative journalism, writing, engineering, and numerous other disciplines. Among his chief concerns are learning how to see the historical moment we live in and developing the means to imagine alternative futures. Trevor Paglen’s work is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Whitney Museum of American Art; Berkeley Art Museum; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; and the Nevada Museum of Art. He has launched an artwork into distant orbit around Earth in collaboration with Creative Time and MIT, contributed research and cinematography to the Academy Award-winning film Citizenfour, and created a radioactive public sculpture for the exclusion zone in Fukushima, Japan. He is a 2017 recipient of the MacArthur Foundation Award. Paglen holds a B.A. from U.C. Berkeley, an MFA from the Art Institute of Chicago, and a Ph.D. in Geography from U.C. Berkeley.",
